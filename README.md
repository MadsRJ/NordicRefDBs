# This page is currently under development, but the idea is to add the steps taken to generate the various reference databases used by the Research Group for Genetics (RGG) at UiT as I progress.

# 💾🧬 NordicRefDBs 🧬💾 #

Welcome to *NordicRefDBs*! This repository serves to illustrate how I've created various reference databases for various metabarcoding markers used in eDNA research at *UiT - The Arctic University of Norway*. 
All databases are here built with the extremely versatile [CRABS](https://github.com/gjeunen/reference_database_creator) software (Jeunen et al. 2023), which interconnects different reference data repositories and harmonizes them with the taxonomic backbone of NCBI. 
**Note**: All CRABS credits should be directed [here](https://github.com/gjeunen/reference_database_creator), I'm just a fan of the toolkit they've developed.

Even if you're just trying to address the 🐘 elephant in the room 🐘, there's probably a right reference database for you! All metabarcoding projects have different scopes and may benefit from a customized reference database with a specific taxonomic or environmental focus, and focusing only on specific marker genes.

Many people rightly advocate not to blindly trust the data found in online reference data repositories (e.g. NCBI, BOLD). However, if the alternative is that each and every one of us will have to create references from organisms that we ourselves have identified from the respective environments that we work in, then the whole purpose behind the public repositories is lost. 
In this GitHub repo, focus is instead on collectively identifying and "blacklisting" those accession numbers that are clearly misidentified, and removing these entries as part of creating the reference database. As with fundamental legal principles, **innocent until proven guilty**, right? I suppose you could view this in legal terms as "all reference barcodes have a right to a fair trial".
I here provide a preliminary blacklist of all accession numbers that I do not trust the taxonomic identification of (or which for other reasons described below might be blacklisted), but feel free to either add to this list locally, or to leave a comment on accession numbers that shouldn't be trusted. If you provide some contextual support for not trusting an accession number in your comment, I'd be happy to update the blacklist to include your suggested entries. 
Also note that each separate reference database created will utilize the same blacklist file as input. It will be subset as part of the script to use only relevant blacklisted accessions, depending on which repository the reference data is retrieved from and what marker is used.

# Requirements/Prerequisites #
All of the databases can be built upon activating a conda environment based on the yml-file provided in this repo. Follow the below steps to create the environment.

```
conda env create -f crabs.yml
conda activate crabs
```

If you are working on SIGMA2/NRIS/EuroHPC infrastructure (e.g. Saga, Fram, Betzy, Olivia, LUMI), the direct use of conda installations is prohibited (or will be soon). An alternative solution is to install using [hpc-container-wrapper](https://github.com/CSCfi/hpc-container-wrapper), essentially wrapping your installation inside an Apptainer/Singularity container to reduce the number of files generated. 
But hey, if you have root access, you're the one commandeering the bioinformatic battleship anyway! 🚢🏴‍☠️⚓️

If you're discouraged to do a direct conda installation, follow the steps below instead (Olivia example with preinstalled hpc-container-wrapper accessed via the NRIS software stack "NRIS/CPU").
#### Note: replace <install_dir> with the path to where you want to make the installation.

```
module purge
source /opt/cray/pe/lmod/lmod/init/profile
export MODULEPATH=/cluster/software/modules/Core/
module load NRIS/CPU
module load hpc-container-wrapper
conda-containerize new --prefix <install_dir> crabs.yml
export PATH="<install_dir>/bin:$PATH"
```

You should now be able to call any executables installed in the environment as if the environment was activated. You can test whether this worked, e.g. by typing:

```
crabs -h
```

# Usage notes #

- At present, there are two different reference databases supported here. One for COI (broad eukaryote) and one for 12S (vertebrates).
- Both of these scripts are bash wrappers around the standard CRABS-commands with additional filtering steps and modifications. These scripts essentially follow the crabs GitHub recommendations most of the way, but do not follow their recommendations completely.

# COI reference database for the "Leray" or "Leray-XT" marker

## Key features
**Target**: 313 bp of the mitochondrial Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI)

**F-primer**: Either mlCOIintF 5′-GGWACWGGWTGAACWGTWTAYCCYCC-3′ (Leray et al., 2013) or mlCOIintF-XT 5′-GGWACWRGWTGRACWITITAYCCYCC-3′ (Wangensteen et al., 2018)

**R-primer**: Either HCO2198 5′-TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA-3′ (Folmer et al., 1994) or jgHCO2198 5′-TAIACYTCIGGRTGICCRAARAAYCA-3′ (Geller et al., 2013)

**Species-level resolution for the majority of metazoans based on current knowledge**

**Known issues with co-amplification of prokaryotes from environmental samples**

Can also serve as reference database for primers amplifying shorter fragments contained within the same 313 bp region, such as:

1) BF1 5′-ACWGGWTGRACWGTNTAYCC-3′ + BR1 5′-ARYATDGTRATDGCHCCDGC-3′ (but do note three bp more on the F-primer end, Elbrecht & Leese, 2017)
2) BF1 5′-ACWGGWTGRACWGTNTAYCC-3′ + BR2 5′-TCDGGRTGNCCRAARAAYCA-3′ (but do note three bp more on the F-primer end, Elbrecht & Leese, 2017)

##

This is the database for those of you who want **one (COI) database to rule them all** for all of your metabarcoding projects - especially those focusing on environmental DNA samples (in contrast to bulk samples where e.g. sorting of specimens would maybe rule out the need for certain taxa in your reference database).
On my setup, it takes ~12-14 hours from start of download to database completion.
To create this monstrosity of a reference database, you obviously need patience. At the time of writing, it downloads >14 million sequences from [BOLD](https://boldsystems.org/) and >1.2 million sequences from [NCBIs nt database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=). 
Generating this database is unfortunately not as smooth-sailing as one could hope for, and this is largely due to heavy traffic on the BOLD servers.

Do note that creation of this reference database does not include any dereplication (as suggested by the CRABS software developers). I mainly use the [MetaBarFlow](https://github.com/evaegelyng/MetaBarFlow/tree/master) pipeline for analyzing metabarcoding data, and the downstream taxonomic identification script takes into account the amount of hits to each taxon for a given query sequence. This would clearly not be possible if the input file for creating the reference database has been dereplicated. 

When downloading the bold database, the download commands have been split into lower-level taxa (e.g. dipteran families) for allowing download to complete (maximum 1 million sequences can be downloaded in a single command). Pay attention when using the taxonlist provided, it currently shrinks in size as your download progresses - i.e., the file depletes itself as you succesfully download. This also updates the counts of taxa required for download and missing to be downloaded.

## To build this database, make sure your environment is activated and run the following script.

```
bash Make_RefDB_LerayXT.sh
```

Notes:
1) The above script is likely to break during the download - if it fails, simply run the above command again until completion. 
2) The database is generated with a datestamp on the directory housing all the relevant files - pay attention to this if updating the reference database overnight, where the current date will change.
3) There was a bug "ERROR | Error running makeblastdb BLAST Database creation error: Error: Duplicate seq_ids are found: GB|EU148067, aborting analysis...". I can't seem to find out why this duplicate arises, but I just deleted the second entry as part of the script.
4) Ensure to update your email in the script (for NCBI)


Once the database is built, you can perform blast searches against the database. An example blast search could look like below. **Note that 1)** The prefix of your database has to be specified (in this case "BLAST_TAX_COI", so not just the path to the directory in which the database is found). **2)** You can replace "OUTFILE.blasthits.txt" and "INPUTFILE.fasta" with I/O names that match your files.
```
blastn -db "path/to/BLAST_TAX_COI" -max_target_seqs 500 -outfmt "6 std qlen qcovs staxid sscinames" -out OUTFILE.blasthits.txt -qcov_hsp_perc 90 -perc_identity 80 -query INPUTFILE.fasta
```


# 🐟 12S reference database for the "MiFish" marker 🐟

## Key features
#### Targeting ~167-182 bp of the mitochondrially encoded 12S ribosomal RNA (12S rRNA) gene
#### Optimized and heavily curated for eDNA analysis of samples from Nordic countries
#### Supports taxonomy from Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes (As per the update on 11th of Nov 2025, Fricke et al. (2025))
#### Works just fine for samples taken outside Nordic regions, but has less curation.
#### F-primer: Either of the below listings.
1) MiFish-U-F (UiT mod.) 5′-GCCGGTAAAACTCGTGCCAGC-3′ (Sales et al., 2019)
2) MiFish-U-F 5′-GTCGGTAAAACTCGTGCCAGC-3′ (Miya et al., 2015)
3) MiFish-E-F 5′-GTTGGTAAATCTCGTGCCAGC-3′ (Miya et al., 2015)
4) Tele02-F 5′-AAACTCGTGCCAGCCACC-3′ (Taberlet et al., 2018, Thomsen et al., 2016)
5) Elas02-F 5′-GTTGGTHAATCTCGTGCCAGC-3′ (Taberlet et al., 2018)

#### R-primer: Either of the below listings.
1) MiFish-U-R 5′-CATAGTGGGGTATCTAATCCCAGTTTG-3′ (Miya et al., 2015)
2) MiFish-E-R 5′-CATAGTGGGGTATCTAATCCTAGTTTG-3′ (Miya et al., 2015)
3) Tele02-R 5′-GGGTATCTAATCCCAGTTTG-3′ (Taberlet et al., 2018)
4) Elas02-R 5′-CATAGTAGGGTATCTAATCCTAGTTTG-3′ (Taberlet et al., 2018)

## To build this database, run the following script.

```
bash Make_RefDB_MiFish.sh
```

Once the database is built, you can perform blast searches against the database. An example blast search could look like below. **Note that 1)** The prefix of your database has to be specified (in this case "BLAST_TAX_12S", so not just the path to the directory in which the database is found). **2)** You can replace "OUTFILE.blasthits" and "INPUTFILE.fasta" with I/O names that match your files.
```
blastn -db "path/to/BLAST_TAX_12S" -max_target_seqs 500 -outfmt "6 std qlen qcovs staxid sscinames" -out OUTFILE.blasthits.txt -qcov_hsp_perc 90 -perc_identity 80 -query INPUTFILE.fasta
```

If you want to assign taxonomy using the Catalog of fishes compliant taxonomy described in the pre-curation steps below, you can match the accession numbers in the blast output with the "refs_sorted.txt" file found in your reference database folder. The example below adds the taxonomy for all hits, and you can work from there with whatever thresholds/filtering approach you want to use for your taxonomic assignment.

```
sort -k2,2 OUTFILE.blasthits.txt > tmp.blasthits.txt
join -1 2 -2 1 -t $'\t' -o 1.1,1.2,1.3,1.4,1.5,1.6,1.7,1.8,1.9,1.10,1.11,1.12,1.13,1.14,1.15,2.2,2.3,2.4,2.5,2.6,2.7,2.8 tmp.blasthits.txt "path/to/refs_sorted.txt" | sort -t $'\t' -k1,1V -k3,3nr > OUTFILE.blasthits.with.taxonomy.txt
```

## The pre-curation:
1) The pre-curation has focused on species existing in Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway incl. the Svalbard archipelago, and Sweden, along with the autonomous territories of the Faroe Islands and Greenland)
2) A list of blacklisted accession numbers will be automatically removed as part of the script.
3) All hybrid specimen accessions and other non-informative identifications have been removed from manual inspections of fish families that exist in Nordic countries (i.e., a "*Gadus* sp." sequence would be removed if an identical "*Gadus morhua*" sequence was present, but retained if not.)
4) Certain accessions are being reinstated post-crabs-filtering. This is primarily because they do not survive the 92 % similarity to other existing sequences during the global pairwise alignment step, and since they do not contain the priming sites. I manually trawled through all the species from Nordic countries and fetched those extra taxa that could be retrieved this way (in instances where the species would otherwise be missing).
5) Known synonymy issues of Nordic species are resolved using genus/species names as currently accepted by Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes (Fricke et al., 2025).
6) Genus to family, family to order, and order to class taxonomies of all species have been updated to reflect those currently accepted by Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes (Fricke et al., 2025). Do note that species not found in Nordic countries will not have had a synonymy check prior to this step, so these will likely continue to be wrongly listed. As an example, *Psetta maxima* is a synonym for *Scophthalmus maximus*, which exists in the database. Had this species not been present in a Nordic country, the species and genus would not be correct, but the remainder of the taxonomic backbone would be. Since it is a species occurring in Nordic countries, it will be corrected to fully match the taxonomy from Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes.
7) For all Nordic species, subspecies identifications (i.e. more than one taxID per species) have been reverted back to respective species taxIDs. This genetic region does not have discriminatory power at the subspecies level anyway.
8) I generally allow 1 ambiguous basepair when building the database, just not for species occurring in Nordic countries (i.e. those are blacklisted).

## The post-curation database check:
Knowing the limits and biases of your reference database is equally important to the efforts going into building it. I've here compiled a list of all fish species known to occur in Nordic countries (see below). This list should be the starting point when inferring taxonomic identities from sequences representing eDNA samples collected in Nordic countries. It includes valid species names, but also includes known synonyms for CTRL+F matching purposes. It lists how many barcodes are present per species for this marker (approximately), the amount of unique sequences per species, primer mismatches to the UiT-version of the MiFish-primers, as well as a list of countries from which the species have been reported. Finally, it includes notes on discriminatory power for the barcode and other useful information on uncertainties and within-species sequence disparities.

## Fishes present in Nordic countries
#### Table of all fish species found in the Nordic countries. All names are reported with Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes as the taxonomic authority (Fricke et al., 2025), and synonyms have been added when encountered in GenBank or elsewhere. The list has been made by combining information from FishBase country lists of species occurrences. It has been supplemented with additions to the Danish fish fauna from Jensen et al. (2022), the Greenland fauna from Jensen et al. (2023) and Møller et al. (2010), and the Norwegian/Arctic fauna by Mecklenburg et al. (2018). Additionally, the Norwegian fish fauna has been supplemented with curated records from the Institute of Marine Research bottom trawl surveys (2004-2021, "NOR-BTS_clean.RData"), as incorporated into [FishGlob](https://github.com/fishglob/FishGlob_data/) (Maureaud et al., 2021, Maureaud et al., 2024). Note that countries listed in brackets under Distribution have uncertainty associated with them.

# Known bugs & icky things in the code #

- I did not test what happens if you want to blacklist the last sequence of the fasta file (either bold or ncbi download) - code likely breaks.
- As a note to myself, I should probably look into including representative bacterial sequences in the COI reference database, as co-amplification of prokaryotes is likely to occur when amplifying this genetic region.
